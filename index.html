<h2> Ancient Roots </h2>
	
	<p> The Code of Hammurabi is well-known for being the first and complete legal codes proclaimed by Babylonian king Hammurabi. Interestingly, it also provided the first documented description of witchcraft, such as how to uncover witches and how they were to be punished. One part of the code described the "swimming test" in which accused witches were tossed into the nearest body of water. If they sank, they were an innocent, but a secret witch would simply bob on the surface.
