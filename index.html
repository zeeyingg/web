<h2> Ancient Roots </h2>
	
	<p> The Code of Hammurabi is well-known for being the first and complete legal codes proclaimed by Babylonian king Hammurabi. Interestingly, it also provided the first documented description of witchcraft, such as how to uncover witches and how they were to be punished. One part of the code described the "swimming test" in which accused witches were tossed into the nearest body of water. If they sank, they were an innocent, but a secret witch would simply bob on the surface.

<h2> Foundations of Western Witchcraft Canon </h2>

	<p> You know the story of Adam and Eve, the first man and woman. But that's a lie. Enter Lilith the forgotten, actual first woman to be created. It's unclear, but she might've also been Adam's first wife. According to myth, she was described to be "mounting" and "penetrating" Adam, popularizing the depiction of a demon as dominant and sexual. Sex becomes the intersection of gender and power. </p>

<h2> Early Medieval </h2>

<p> In the 13th-14th century, the true existence of witchcraft was being hotly debated. The two leading figures of the time: St. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas were at the forefront of this conversation. St. Augustine, a theologian, believed that only God can suspend laws of the universe, and therfore, doesn't believe in witchcraft. Thomas Aquinas, on the other hand, believed that ordinary people can turn to witches if they make a communing with the devil, formally declaring them as heretics. Years later, Aquinas's beliefs would lay the groundwork for modern witchcraft while St. Augustine's ideas would slowly sink into deep water.</p>
